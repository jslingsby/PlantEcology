The Ecosystem Monitoring for Management Application (EMMA) is a NASA funded project to develop a near-real-time satellite change detection system for the Fynbos Biome using an ecological forecasting approach. It is based on the proof of concept published in [Slingsby et al. 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.05.017).
